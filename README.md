I want to explore TDD, and ruby object-oriented coding.

This app is the vehicle by which I am attempting to do this.

It is/will be a re-implementation of my flac2mp3 script in ruby, with an object-oriented approach, and with full test coverage.

The initial app structure and test/gem code is shamelessly stolen from Jordan Sissel's fpm project.
